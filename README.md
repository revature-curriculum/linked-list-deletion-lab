# Lab Instructions
Here we will be deleting an object from our Custom Linked List, specifically the first instance of the provided object. 
To do this we will need to implemnt the `remove()` method. You do not need to remove duplicates of the object. 
After the object is removed, the list should still be linked from start to finish.
The `remove()` method will return a boolean value corresponding with whether or not the object was removed or not:
- If the object is found and removed, return **true**
- If the object is not found, return **false**
